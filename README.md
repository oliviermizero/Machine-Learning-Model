# Machine-Learning-Model-Using-MaskRCNN
Comprehensive Machine Learning Model for Image Segmentation

This Folder Should contain everything, except the bulk of the code, which is located 
https://github.com/CChristenson1/Mask_RCNN.git
Included here is:
-	A list of possible feature to extract and ideas on how to do so.
-	The code to split, and project the videos to individual images
-	The code to combine the generated data to a larger csv file. NOTE: This code needs to be update for the new directories.
-	The video manifests, which are used to split the large videos to smaller ones.
-	The most up to date model I trained mask_rcnn_maise_0117.h5.
